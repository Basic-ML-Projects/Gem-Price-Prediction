# Gem-Price-Prediction
A through hands-on work through of Kaggle's Gem Price Prediction dataset. The point of this project was meant to be an experiment of sorts. Since the goal of the project was to implement different methods and try out different ways of getting the best possible model, EDA for the most part was done automatically. The reports.ipynb contains a brief analysis of the data using information from pandas-profiling. In the real world, we want not only the best possible model, but we also need to do it within a certain time limit. With this being said, there is also an evaluation of time spent vs accuracy increase.
